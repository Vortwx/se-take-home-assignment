# Code Logic
- Javascript
- bot,manager,customer (interface for vip and normal)
- order (normal, VIP)
- STATUS.PENDING, STATUS.COMPLETE
- possible conflict on task distribution
- bot stored in stack (LIFO)

# UI
- HTML & CSS


First focus on CLI


# Edge Case
- Solve problem that existing bot won't take the remaining orders (Need state to run over for checking)
- Make the order stacked inside card (v)
